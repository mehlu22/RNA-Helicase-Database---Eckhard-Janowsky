# RNA-Helicase-Database---Eckhard-Jankowsky

This is the updated version of the RNA helicase database from 2010.

The RNA helicase database provides systematic and curated information on RNA helicases, enzymes that bind and remodel RNA and RNA-protein complexes in an ATP-dependent manner. In eukaryotes, different RNA helicases are involved in essentially all aspects of RNA metabolism. RNA helicases are also found in bacteria and in many viruses. Mutations and deregulation of RNA helicases have been linked to numerous diseases including cancers, neurological diseases, and developmental defects. Several helicases are important host-factors for infectious diseases and viral RNA helicases represent targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics.

The database was created by Soon Yi, Mehlam Saifudeen, Anja Jankowsky, and Eckhard Jankowsky. Eckhard developed the concept. Technical and graphical implementation were realized by Soon, Mehlam, and Anja. The scientific content was compiled by Soon, Mehlam, Anja, and Eckhard with help from Maggie Fairman.

Eckhard Jankowsky is Professor at the Center for RNA Science and Therapeutics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Soon Yi is an MD-PhD student in his group. Mehlam Saifudeen is an undergraduate student majoring in Systems Biology and Computer Science in the lab group. Work in the Jankowsky lab is focusing on roles and mechanisms of RNA helicases and other proteins that interact with RNA (jankowskylab.org)
